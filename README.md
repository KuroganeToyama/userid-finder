# UserID Finder
This is a Python script to quickly search for a student's userid from the database. <br>
Once again, the story comes from my time as an Instructional Support Assistant. <br>
Whenever a student has some questions about their submissions, I always have to manually find their userid to see their files (It's just Ctrl + F but I still don't like it because the website is damn slow). <br>
And it's also about time I learn some basics with SQL queries. <br>
So there you have it. <br>
